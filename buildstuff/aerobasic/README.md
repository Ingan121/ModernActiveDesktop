**7.css** is a CSS framework that takes semantic HTML and styles them to the Windows 7 design.
It is built on top of [XP.css](https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css), which is an extension of [98.CSS](https://github.com/jdan/98.css).

It does not ship with any JavaScript, so it is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.
