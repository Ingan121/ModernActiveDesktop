Localization files are omitted because jspaint has too much files and Wallpaper Engine editor gets stuck because of this.
This version is based on https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/commit/c5cf78424ce58c0e7bb81c7de882641ec9dc30ae.
Full version with MAD additions is currently being hosted at https://www.ingan121.com/mad/apps/jspaint.
Clone the above-mentioned commit and put localization files here if you want to use full jspaint locally.
